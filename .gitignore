# HW : exclude the entire hw_platform folder, as we'll regenerate 
# everything from the .hdf file. Include the bitstream in the .hdf file 
# when exporting from Vivado!

# BSP : only keep .cproject, .project, .sdkproject, .system.mss and Makefile
# i.e. the ps7_cortexa9_0 lib files are regenerated automatically
